[Function Intermediate Value Property] Let $f: [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function defined on a closed interval such that its graph can be drawn without lifting the pen. If $y_0$ is any value strictly between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there must exist some $c \in (a, b)$ for which $f(c) = y_0$. (Target Concept: Intermediate Value Theorem)
[Matrix Annhilation by Characteristic Polynomial] Consider a square $n \times n$ matrix $A$ over a field. Let $p(\lambda) = \det(A - \lambda I)$ be the polynomial obtained from the determinant of $A$ minus $\lambda$ times the identity matrix. If the matrix $A$ itself is substituted for $\lambda$ in this polynomial, resulting in $p(A)$, the outcome is the $n \times n$ zero matrix. (Target Concept: Cayley-Hamilton Theorem)
[Substructure Size Divisibility] Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a finite algebraic structure satisfying group axioms. Let $H$ be a non-empty subset of $G$ that is closed under the operation $\cdot$ and includes inverses for all its elements. Then, the number of elements in $H$, denoted $|H|$, must exactly divide the total number of elements in $G$, denoted $|G|$. (Target Concept: Lagrange's Theorem)
[Mapping a Disk to Itself Requires Unmoved Point] Let $B^n = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n : \|x\| \le 1\}$ denote the closed unit ball in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. If $f: B^n \to B^n$ is a map without jumps or breaks that sends every point in the ball to some point (possibly different) also within the ball, then there must be at least one point $x_0 \in B^n$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$.

[Sum of Random Variables Approaching Bell Curve] Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_N$ be a sequence of independent random variables, all drawn from the same distribution which has a well-defined mean $\mu$ and a finite, non-zero variance $\sigma^2$. Define the sample average $\bar{X}_N = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N X_i$. For large $N$, the probability distribution of the centered and scaled average, $\sqrt{N}(\bar{X}_N - \mu)/\sigma$, closely resembles the standard Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$.

[Integral Over Region vs. Boundary] Let $\omega$ be a smooth $(k-1)$-differential form defined on an oriented $k$-dimensional smooth manifold $M$ with boundary $\partial M$. The integral of the exterior derivative $d\omega$ over the region $M$ is equal to the integral of $\omega$ over its boundary $\partial M$, i.e., $\int_M d\omega = \int_{\partial M} \omega$. (Target Concept: Generalized Stokes' Theorem)
[Continuous Symmetry Implies Conserved Quantity] Consider a physical system whose dynamics are derived from an action principle $S = \int L(q, \dot{q}, t) dt$. If the action possesses a continuous differentiable symmetry transformation depending on $k$ parameters, meaning the Lagrangian $L$ changes by at most a total time derivative under this transformation, then there exist $k$ distinct functions of the system's state variables (coordinates $q$ and velocities $\dot{q}$) that remain constant over time as the system evolves according to the equations of motion. (Target Concept: Noether's Theorem)
[Matrix Decomposition for Self-Adjoint Operators] Let $A$ be a self-adjoint (or Hermitian) linear operator acting on a finite-dimensional inner product space $V$. Then there exists an orthonormal basis of $V$ consisting entirely of eigenvectors of $A$. Equivalently, $A$ can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation: $A = U D U^\dagger$, where $U$ is unitary and $D$ is a real diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues.
