[Function with Bounded Differences] Let $f$ be a real-valued function of $n$ independent variables, $X = (X_1, \dots, X_n)$. Assume that for any $i$, replacing $X_i$ with an independent copy $X'_i$ changes the value of $f$ by at most $c_i$: $|f(\dots, X_i, \dots) - f(\dots, X'_i, \dots)| \le c_i$. Let $Z = f(X)$. We wish to prove the deviation inequality: $$\mathbb{P}(|Z - \mathbb{E}[Z]| \ge t) \le 2 \exp\left( - \frac{2t^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n c_i^2} \right)$$
[Eigenvalue Concentration for Matrix Sums] Let $X_k$ be a sequence of $n$ independent random $d \times d$ Hermitian matrices with $0 \preceq X_k \preceq M \cdot I$. Let $S = \sum_{k=1}^n X_k$ and let $\mu_{\max} = \lambda_{\max}(\mathbb{E}[S])$. We wish to prove a tail bound for the largest eigenvalue of $S$: $$\mathbb{P}\left( \lambda_{\max}(S) \ge (1+\delta) \mu_{\max} \right) \le d \cdot \exp\left( - C \frac{\mu_{\max}}{M} ((1+\delta)\log(1+\delta) - \delta) \right)$$
[Isoperimetry on Product Spaces] Let $A$ be a subset of a product probability space $\Omega = \prod_{i=1}^n \Omega_i$ with measure $\mu(A) \ge 1/2$. Let $X$ be a random variable drawn from $\mu$. We seek to show that $X$ is unlikely to be "far" from $A$. Specifically, let $d_H(x, A)$ be the Hamming distance from $x$ to the set $A$. We wish to prove an isoperimetric inequality of the form: $$\mathbb{P}(d_H(X, A) \ge t) \le C \exp(-c t^2)$$
[Concentration of Gaussian Polynomials] Let $X \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I_n)$ be a standard Gaussian vector. Let $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be a polynomial of fixed total degree $d \ge 2$. Let $Z = f(X)$. We wish to prove that $Z$ satisfies a strong concentration inequality, even though $f$ is not globally Lipschitz. We seek to relate $\mathrm{Var}(Z)$ to $\mathbb{E}[\|\nabla f(X)\|_2^2]$ and show that $Z$ has exponential-type tails of the form: $$\mathbb{P}(|Z - \mathbb{E}[Z]| \ge t) \le C \exp( -c t^{2/d} )$$
