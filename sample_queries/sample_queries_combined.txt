[Spin Glass Ground State] Consider the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of a spin glass. The system consists of $N$ spins, $s_i \in \{-1, +1\}$, whose energy is described by the Hamiltonian: $ H = - \sum_{1 \le i < j \le N} J_{ij} s_i s_j $ where the couplings $J_{ij}$ are independent and identically distributed random variables drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. The problem is to find the ground state of the system, which is the specific configuration of spins $\{s_1, s_2, \dots, s_N\}$ that minimizes the value of the Hamiltonian $H$.
[Efficient Coding] The firing patterns and receptive fields of sensory neurons are adapted to the statistical structure of the natural signals they encounter. The neural code is optimized to represent these signals efficiently by minimizing statistical redundancy. This process, known as redundancy reduction, allows for a faithful representation of sensory stimuli using a limited dynamic range and number of neurons.
[Discrete Population Growth] Let $x_n$ be the ratio of an existing population to the maximum possible population, such that $x_n \in [0, 1]$. The evolution of the population from one generation ($n$) to the next ($n+1$) is described by the discrete logistic map: $ x_{n+1} = r x_n (1 - x_n) $ Here, the parameter $r \in [0, 4]$ represents a combined rate for reproduction and starvation. The model describes how, for certain values of the growth rate $r$, the population size can exhibit stable, periodic, or highly unpredictable fluctuations over time.
Let $f: (-1, 1) \to (-1, 1)$ be a real analytic function satisfying $f(0) = 0$ and $|f'(0)| = \alpha < 1$.Then for any $x \in (-1, 1)$, the following global contraction inequality holds:$ \frac{|f(x)|}{1-|f(x)|} \le \left( \frac{\alpha+|x|}{1+|x|} \right) \frac{|x|}{1-|x|}. $
Let $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{p}$ be the position and momentum operators for a quantum particle, which satisfy the canonical commutation relation $[\hat{x}, \hat{p}] = i\hbar$.
[The Pinhole Camera] Consider the projection of a point $P=(X, Y, Z)$ in three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional image plane located at $Z=f$, where $f$ is the focal length. The center of projection is at the origin $(0,0,0)$. The projected image point $p=(x,y)$ is the intersection of the line passing through the origin and $P$ with the image plane. This mapping is given by the perspective projection equations: $ x = f \frac{X}{Z} \quad \text{and} \quad y = f \frac{Y}{Z}. $ This transformation maps 3D world coordinates to 2D image coordinates.
[Kirchhoff's Circuit Laws] For any lumped electrical circuit composed of electronic components, the following two laws hold: 1. Current Law (KCL): At any node (junction) in the circuit, the sum of currents flowing into that node is equal to the sum of currents flowing out of that node. Equivalently, the algebraic sum of currents in a network of conductors meeting at a point is zero. 2. Voltage Law (KVL): The directed sum of the potential differences (voltages) around any closed loop in the circuit is zero.
Let $A$ be a square $n \times n$ matrix with real or complex entries. The problem is to find all non-zero vectors $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{C}^n$ and their corresponding scalars $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ that satisfy the equation: $ A\mathbf{v} = \lambda\mathbf{v} $ This condition states that the action of the matrix $A$ on the vector $\mathbf{v}$ results in a vector that is parallel to $\mathbf{v}$, scaled by the factor $\lambda$.
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold, and let $X$ and $Y$ be two vector fields on $M$. Let $\phi_t$ denote the flow generated by the vector field $X$. The change of the vector field $Y$ along the flow of $X$ at a point $p \in M$ is defined by the following limit:$ \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{(d\phi_{-t})_{\phi_t(p)}(Y_{\phi_t(p)}) - Y_p}{t} $ where $(d\phi_{-t})_{\phi_t(p)}$ is the differential (or pushforward) of the map $\phi_{-t}$, which transports a tangent vector at $\phi_t(p)$ back to the tangent space at $p$. This operation defines a new vector field on $M$.
[Function Intermediate Value Property] Let $f: [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function defined on a closed interval such that its graph can be drawn without lifting the pen. If $y_0$ is any value strictly between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then there must exist some $c \in (a, b)$ for which $f(c) = y_0$. (Target Concept: Intermediate Value Theorem)
[Matrix Annhilation by Characteristic Polynomial] Consider a square $n \times n$ matrix $A$ over a field. Let $p(\lambda) = \det(A - \lambda I)$ be the polynomial obtained from the determinant of $A$ minus $\lambda$ times the identity matrix. If the matrix $A$ itself is substituted for $\lambda$ in this polynomial, resulting in $p(A)$, the outcome is the $n \times n$ zero matrix. (Target Concept: Cayley-Hamilton Theorem)
[Substructure Size Divisibility] Let $(G, \cdot)$ be a finite algebraic structure satisfying group axioms. Let $H$ be a non-empty subset of $G$ that is closed under the operation $\cdot$ and includes inverses for all its elements. Then, the number of elements in $H$, denoted $|H|$, must exactly divide the total number of elements in $G$, denoted $|G|$. (Target Concept: Lagrange's Theorem)
[Mapping a Disk to Itself Requires Unmoved Point] Let $B^n = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^n : \|x\| \le 1\}$ denote the closed unit ball in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. If $f: B^n \to B^n$ is a map without jumps or breaks that sends every point in the ball to some point (possibly different) also within the ball, then there must be at least one point $x_0 \in B^n$ such that $f(x_0) = x_0$. (Target Concept: Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem)
[Sum of Random Variables Approaching Bell Curve] Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_N$ be a sequence of independent random variables, all drawn from the same distribution which has a well-defined mean $\mu$ and a finite, non-zero variance $\sigma^2$. Define the sample average $\bar{X}_N = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N X_i$. For large $N$, the probability distribution of the centered and scaled average, $\sqrt{N}(\bar{X}_N - \mu)/\sigma$, closely resembles the standard Gaussian distribution $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. (Target Concept: Central Limit Theorem)
[Integral Over Region vs. Boundary] Let $\omega$ be a smooth $(k-1)$-differential form defined on an oriented $k$-dimensional smooth manifold $M$ with boundary $\partial M$. The integral of the exterior derivative $d\omega$ over the region $M$ is equal to the integral of $\omega$ over its boundary $\partial M$, i.e., $\int_M d\omega = \int_{\partial M} \omega$. (Target Concept: Generalized Stokes' Theorem)
[Continuous Symmetry Implies Conserved Quantity] Consider a physical system whose dynamics are derived from an action principle $S = \int L(q, \dot{q}, t) dt$. If the action possesses a continuous differentiable symmetry transformation depending on $k$ parameters, meaning the Lagrangian $L$ changes by at most a total time derivative under this transformation, then there exist $k$ distinct functions of the system's state variables (coordinates $q$ and velocities $\dot{q}$) that remain constant over time as the system evolves according to the equations of motion. (Target Concept: Noether's Theorem)
[Matrix Decomposition for Self-Adjoint Operators] Let $A$ be a self-adjoint (or Hermitian) linear operator acting on a finite-dimensional inner product space $V$. Then there exists an orthonormal basis of $V$ consisting entirely of eigenvectors of $A$. Equivalently, $A$ can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation: $A = U D U^\dagger$, where $U$ is unitary and $D$ is a real diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues. (Target Concept: Spectral Theorem for Hermitian Matrices)[Function with Bounded Differences] Let $f$ be a real-valued function of $n$ independent variables, $X = (X_1, \dots, X_n)$. Assume that for any $i$, replacing $X_i$ with an independent copy $X'_i$ changes the value of $f$ by at most $c_i$: $|f(\dots, X_i, \dots) - f(\dots, X'_i, \dots)| \le c_i$. Let $Z = f(X)$. We wish to prove the deviation inequality: $$\mathbb{P}(|Z - \mathbb{E}[Z]| \ge t) \le 2 \exp\left( - \frac{2t^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n c_i^2} \right)$$
[Eigenvalue Concentration for Matrix Sums] Let $X_k$ be a sequence of $n$ independent random $d \times d$ Hermitian matrices with $0 \preceq X_k \preceq M \cdot I$. Let $S = \sum_{k=1}^n X_k$ and let $\mu_{\max} = \lambda_{\max}(\mathbb{E}[S])$. We wish to prove a tail bound for the largest eigenvalue of $S$: $$\mathbb{P}\left( \lambda_{\max}(S) \ge (1+\delta) \mu_{\max} \right) \le d \cdot \exp\left( - C \frac{\mu_{\max}}{M} ((1+\delta)\log(1+\delta) - \delta) \right)$$
[Isoperimetry on Product Spaces] Let $A$ be a subset of a product probability space $\Omega = \prod_{i=1}^n \Omega_i$ with measure $\mu(A) \ge 1/2$. Let $X$ be a random variable drawn from $\mu$. We seek to show that $X$ is unlikely to be "far" from $A$. Specifically, let $d_H(x, A)$ be the Hamming distance from $x$ to the set $A$. We wish to prove an isoperimetric inequality of the form: $$\mathbb{P}(d_H(X, A) \ge t) \le C \exp(-c t^2)$$
[Concentration of Gaussian Polynomials] Let $X \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I_n)$ be a standard Gaussian vector. Let $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be a polynomial of fixed total degree $d \ge 2$. Let $Z = f(X)$. We wish to prove that $Z$ satisfies a strong concentration inequality, even though $f$ is not globally Lipschitz. We seek to relate $\mathrm{Var}(Z)$ to $\mathbb{E}[\|\nabla f(X)\|_2^2]$ and show that $Z$ has exponential-type tails of the form: $$\mathbb{P}(|Z - \mathbb{E}[Z]| \ge t) \le C \exp( -c t^{2/d} )$$
