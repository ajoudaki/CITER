    "    \"\"\"Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition introduces skip connections that allow training of very deep neural networks by addressing the vanishing gradient problem. The approach enables successful training of networks with hundreds of layers, leading to significant improvements in visual recognition tasks. The key innovation is the residual learning framework that explicitly reformulates layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, rather than learning unreferenced functions. These skip connections allow gradients to flow directly through the network, enabling much deeper architectures to be trained effectively. Empirically, residual networks are easier to optimize and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth, producing results substantially better than previous networks on the ImageNet dataset.\"\"\",\n",

    "    \"\"\"BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding presents a new language representation model that uses bidirectional training of Transformer to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text. Unlike previous models which looked at a text sequence either from left to right or combined left-to-right and right-to-left training, BERT jointly conditions on both left and right context in all layers. The pre-training tasks include masked language modeling where some percentage of input tokens are masked and the model attempts to predict them, and next sentence prediction where the model learns relationships between sentences. This approach enables BERT to achieve state-of-the-art performance on eleven natural language processing tasks including GLUE, MultiNLI, and SQuAD, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications.\"\"\",\n",

    "    \"\"\"ELECTRA: Pre-training Text Encoders as Discriminators Rather Than Generators introduces a more sample-efficient pre-training task that predicts whether tokens have been replaced by a generator network. Instead of masking input tokens and training the network to reconstruct them like BERT, ELECTRA trains a discriminative model that predicts whether each token in the corrupted input was replaced by a generator network or not. This replaced token detection pre-training task is more computationally efficient than masked language modeling, requiring only a fraction of the compute to achieve similar performance. The method's efficiency comes from training the model on all input tokens rather than just a small masked subset, allowing it to learn from more positions per input.\"\"\",\n",

    "    \"\"\"AlphaFold 2: Highly accurate protein structure prediction presents a system that can predict protein structures with atomic accuracy, revolutionizing structural biology. The system uses a novel neural network architecture that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, including an attention-based neural network operating over evolutionarily related sequences, and a novel equivariant attention network that builds a representation of atomic coordinates in 3D space. The model was trained end-to-end to optimize structure predictions by combining multiple objectives. It achieves unprecedented levels of accuracy on protein structure prediction, reaching accuracy competitive with experimental methods in many cases and far surpassing previous computational methods.\"\"\",\n",

The architecture factorizes standard convolutions into depth-wise convolutions that filter input channels and point-wise convolutions that combine filtered outputs. This factorization dramatically reduces computation and model size. Additionally, the paper introduces width and resolution multipliers as parameters to further reduce computational cost. These innovations make MobileNets particularly suitable for mobile and embedded vision applications, achieving accuracy comparable to larger networks while being significantly more efficient in terms of size and computation.\"\"\",\n",

    "    \"\"\"Dropout: A Simple Way to Prevent Neural Networks from Overfitting proposes randomly dropping units during training as an efficient way to prevent co-adaptation of neurons. The technique temporarily removes random neurons along with their connections during training, forcing the network to learn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of neurons. Each training case uses a different random configuration, equivalent to training a large ensemble of neural networks with extensive weight sharing. The method significantly reduces overfitting and provides major improvements over other regularization methods, proving particularly effective in large networks with many parameters.\"\"\",\n",

    "    \"\"\"Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms presents a new family of policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning that alternate between sampling data through interaction with the environment and optimizing a surrogate objective function. The key innovation is a new objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates while preventing destructively large policy changes. PPO uses a clipped probability ratio in the objective function to penalize steps that would move the policy too far from the previous version. This approach provides the performance benefits of trust region policy optimization while being much simpler to implement and tune. The algorithm demonstrates robust performance across a wide range of tasks while requiring minimal hyperparameter tuning.\"\"\",\n",

The method computes individual adaptive learning rates for different parameters from estimates of first and second moments of the gradients. It combines the advantages of two popular methods: AdaGrad's ability to deal with sparse gradients and RMSProp's ability to deal with non-stationary objectives. Adam is computationally efficient, requires little memory, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of gradients, and is well-suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The paper provides proof of convergence and empirically demonstrates superior performance compared to other stochastic optimization methods.\"\"\",\n",

The approach divides an image into fixed-size patches, linearly embeds each patch, adds position embeddings, and feeds the resulting sequence of vectors to a standard Transformer encoder. When pre-trained on large amounts of data, Vision Transformers (ViT) attain excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially less computational resources to train. This work challenges the dominance of convolutional architectures in computer vision and suggests that transformer-based models might be sufficient as a general architecture for computer vision tasks.\"\"\",\n",

    "    \"\"\"Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift introduces a technique to normalize each layer's inputs by adjusting and scaling activations using running statistics computed during training. This addresses the internal covariate shift problem where the distribution of network activations changes during training as parameters of previous layers change. By normalizing activations to have specified mean and variance, batch normalization enables higher learning rates and acts as a regularizer. The technique dramatically reduces training time, improves performance, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. It has become a standard component in most deep neural network architectures.\"\"\",\n",

The architecture builds on Progressive GANs but redesigns the generator to control image synthesis via scale-specific modifications of the latent code. This enables automatic, unsupervised separation of high-level attributes (e.g., pose, identity) from stochastic variation (e.g., freckles, hair) in the generated images. The method also introduces several improvements to the training process and introduces new ways to quantify GAN performance, leading to state-of-the-art results in terms of both quality and variation.\"\"\",\n",

The resulting Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) framework achieves state-of-the-art results on many NLP benchmarks while being flexible enough to be fine-tuned for any text-based task.

The baseline network (EfficientNet-B0) demonstrates strong performance, and when scaled up, the approach consistently outperforms previous ConvNets while using orders of magnitude fewer parameters.
