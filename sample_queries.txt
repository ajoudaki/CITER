[Spin Glass Ground State] Consider the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model of a spin glass. The system consists of $N$ spins, $s_i \in \{-1, +1\}$, whose energy is described by the Hamiltonian: $ H = - \sum_{1 \le i < j \le N} J_{ij} s_i s_j $ where the couplings $J_{ij}$ are independent and identically distributed random variables drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. The problem is to find the ground state of the system, which is the specific configuration of spins $\{s_1, s_2, \dots, s_N\}$ that minimizes the value of the Hamiltonian $H$.
[Efficient Coding] The firing patterns and receptive fields of sensory neurons are adapted to the statistical structure of the natural signals they encounter. The neural code is optimized to represent these signals efficiently by minimizing statistical redundancy. This process, known as redundancy reduction, allows for a faithful representation of sensory stimuli using a limited dynamic range and number of neurons.
[Discrete Population Growth] Let $x_n$ be the ratio of an existing population to the maximum possible population, such that $x_n \in [0, 1]$. The evolution of the population from one generation ($n$) to the next ($n+1$) is described by the discrete logistic map: $ x_{n+1} = r x_n (1 - x_n) $ Here, the parameter $r \in [0, 4]$ represents a combined rate for reproduction and starvation. The model describes how, for certain values of the growth rate $r$, the population size can exhibit stable, periodic, or highly unpredictable fluctuations over time.
Let $f: (-1, 1) \to (-1, 1)$ be a real analytic function satisfying $f(0) = 0$ and $|f'(0)| = \alpha < 1$.Then for any $x \in (-1, 1)$, the following global contraction inequality holds:$ \frac{|f(x)|}{1-|f(x)|} \le \left( \frac{\alpha+|x|}{1+|x|} \right) \frac{|x|}{1-|x|}. $
Let $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{p}$ be the position and momentum operators for a quantum particle, which satisfy the canonical commutation relation $[\hat{x}, \hat{p}] = i\hbar$.
[The Pinhole Camera] Consider the projection of a point $P=(X, Y, Z)$ in three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional image plane located at $Z=f$, where $f$ is the focal length. The center of projection is at the origin $(0,0,0)$. The projected image point $p=(x,y)$ is the intersection of the line passing through the origin and $P$ with the image plane. This mapping is given by the perspective projection equations: $ x = f \frac{X}{Z} \quad \text{and} \quad y = f \frac{Y}{Z}. $ This transformation maps 3D world coordinates to 2D image coordinates.
[Kirchhoff's Circuit Laws] For any lumped electrical circuit composed of electronic components, the following two laws hold: 1. Current Law (KCL): At any node (junction) in the circuit, the sum of currents flowing into that node is equal to the sum of currents flowing out of that node. Equivalently, the algebraic sum of currents in a network of conductors meeting at a point is zero. 2. Voltage Law (KVL): The directed sum of the potential differences (voltages) around any closed loop in the circuit is zero.
Let $A$ be a square $n \times n$ matrix with real or complex entries. The problem is to find all non-zero vectors $\mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{C}^n$ and their corresponding scalars $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$ that satisfy the equation: $ A\mathbf{v} = \lambda\mathbf{v} $ This condition states that the action of the matrix $A$ on the vector $\mathbf{v}$ results in a vector that is parallel to $\mathbf{v}$, scaled by the factor $\lambda$.
Let $M$ be a smooth manifold, and let $X$ and $Y$ be two vector fields on $M$. Let $\phi_t$ denote the flow generated by the vector field $X$. The change of the vector field $Y$ along the flow of $X$ at a point $p \in M$ is defined by the following limit:$ \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{(d\phi_{-t})_{\phi_t(p)}(Y_{\phi_t(p)}) - Y_p}{t} $ where $(d\phi_{-t})_{\phi_t(p)}$ is the differential (or pushforward) of the map $\phi_{-t}$, which transports a tangent vector at $\phi_t(p)$ back to the tangent space at $p$. This operation defines a new vector field on $M$.
